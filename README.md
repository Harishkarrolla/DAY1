# DAY1 
Today I have Setup the SQL Workbench and I have taken "Online Course Management System"as the domain where I have worked on it and created the database named "onlineC" by using it I have created 10 entities and created tables for the entities.
By using CREATE I have created Database,Table.
BY using SELECT I have displayed the table.
BY using INSERT I have inserted the values into tables.
